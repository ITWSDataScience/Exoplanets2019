# Exoplanets 

## What is this dataset about? Why did you choose it?

We selected exoplanet data because planets provide interesting visualizations and one of our group members has experience with this kind of data. The data is open source and hosted in collaboration with NASA and CalTech:  

We combed through the metadata provided to decide which attributes would be relevant to our planned visualizations and models, and their user interface allows us to selectively download the datasets with our specified useful columns.


## What questions are you answering?
We're interested in answering two specific questions with respect to your dataset.

Question 1:
We’re interested in understanding how the exoplanets that have been confirmed and are listed on the dataset compare to planets as we know them belonging to our galaxy. 

Question 2:
We’re also interested in understanding what role each discovery facility has played in the discovery of the exoplanets in totality. This question would be best answered through a histogram denoting the number of discoveries versus the facility.
